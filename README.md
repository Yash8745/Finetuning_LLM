# NLP Practice Repository

This repository is a personal space for experimenting and learning Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts and techniques. It includes various projects, scripts, and tutorials to help solidify your understanding of NLP. ** If you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to contribute! and Let me know if you know skills I can learn to improve my skills as Machine Learning Engineer.**

## Scripts

1. **Text Generation**  
   Practice generating text using pre-trained models like GPT-2 or GPT-3.
   - Example: `notebooks/text_generation.ipynb`

2. **Summarization**  
   Experiment with summarizing long text using models like BART and PEGASUS.
   - Example: `notebooks/summarization.ipynb`

3. **Fine-Tuning for Classification**  
   Fine-tune models like DistilBERT for multi-label or binary classification tasks.
   - Example: `scripts/fine_tune_classification.py`

4. **Sentiment Analysis**  
   Analyze the sentiment of text using pre-trained or fine-tuned models.
   - Example: `notebooks/sentiment_analysis.ipynb`

5. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**  
   Train or fine-tune models for identifying named entities in text.
   - Example: `notebooks/ner_tagging.ipynb`

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NLP-Practice.git
   cd NLP-Practice
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   conda create env -n nlp python=3.8
   conda activate nlp
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running 

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Navigate to the `notebooks` directory and open the desired `.ipynb` file.
