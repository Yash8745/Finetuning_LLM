## Flask Application

The repository includes a Flask application to make sentiment analysis accessible to users. The app utilizes a model fine-tuned using full fine-tuning of DistilBERT. Users can input text and get the sentiment prediction via the web interface.

- Application File: `app.py`
- How to run the app:
  ```sh
  python app.py
  ```

## Techniques and Approaches

### Full Fine-Tuning
Full fine-tuning involves updating all the weights of a pre-trained model on a new dataset. This approach allows the model to learn domain-specific nuances but can be computationally expensive and requires significant labeled data. It is particularly effective when the pre-trained model and target task have minimal overlap.

Key Advantages:
- Maximizes model adaptation to the target task.
- Retains the flexibility to fine-tune for complex and specific use cases.

Limitations:
- Requires substantial computational resources.
- Higher risk of overfitting on small datasets.

### Prompt Engineering
Prompt engineering involves crafting inputs to guide the model's behavior without altering its internal weights. By providing task-specific prompts, we can leverage pre-trained models effectively without additional training.

Key Concepts:
- Task-specific prompting: Framing inputs to align with the target task.
- Few-shot prompting: Including a few examples in the input to guide the model.

Advantages:
- Quick to implement and does not require model retraining.
- Cost-effective for tasks with limited data.

Challenges:
- Prompt design can be non-trivial and may require iterative refinement.

### QLoRA (Quantized LoRA)
QLoRA is an advanced technique that combines low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with quantization for efficient fine-tuning. By freezing most of the model's parameters and training smaller rank adaptation layers, QLoRA reduces the computational burden while maintaining performance.

Key Steps:
1. Freeze pre-trained model weights.
2. Insert trainable low-rank adapters into specific layers.
3. Quantize model weights to reduce memory footprint.

Advantages:
- Reduces computational requirements and memory usage.
- Preserves the pre-trained model's generalization capabilities.

Use Cases:
- Ideal for deploying fine-tuned models on edge devices.
- Suitable for iterative experimentation with limited resources.

### LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
LoRA focuses on fine-tuning a subset of parameters within the model, typically through low-rank matrices inserted into existing layers. This method is highly parameter-efficient and reduces the cost of fine-tuning.

Key Benefits:
- Dramatically reduces the number of trainable parameters.
- Enables efficient fine-tuning even on smaller GPUs.

Applications:
- Task-specific adaptation for LLMs.
- Efficient transfer learning in resource-constrained environments.
